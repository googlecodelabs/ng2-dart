Dart Code Lab Samples
============================

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/dart-lang/one-hour-codelab/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/dart-lang/one-hour-codelab/latest)

These are small Dart samples used by two codelabs:

* [Avast Ye, Pirates][client-codelab], where you learn to build a web app. This lab should take about an hour to complete.
* [Beware the Nest o' Pirates][server-codelab] which shows you how to write a RESTful Dart server.

Repository and testing
----------------

Currently, drone.io tests only whether the .dart files under web/ pass static analysis (dartanalyzer). We could do real unit testing, and we could do better with HTML samples.
